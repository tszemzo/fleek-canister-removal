# Fleek canister removal

### Important note:

The wallet module and the ```createWalletActor.ts``` file were added just to give context to the project as this little project doesnt't support typescript, they were extracted from fleek-v2 repo.

In order to run the project apart from the steps below you should probably comment / test / fix the content of the ```if``` statement inside removeCanister file
